My project is called "Space Jump" and it is similar to the game "Doodle
Jump" or any other jumping platform game of that matter. It is an arcarde
game where the objective is to jump on platforms and try to make it as high
as you can without getting hit by enemies.

To run this game, you will need Python 3 as well as Tkinter (which comes with
the installation). If you do not have Python 3 installed in your device,
go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install the latest Python 3 version.
Once you have downloaded Python 3, open up the file jump.py and run that file
to start the game.

Enjoy!
